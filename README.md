# 4-Cyclic-Graph-Detector
This code is part of the 2024 WXML Quiver Mutation, a special Cluster Algebra Research Project @UW. The main purpose of the code is to check whether a directed graph with four vertices and variable weights can be transformed into a 4-cyclic graph through a finite number of mutations.
