# 4-Cyclic-Graph-Detector
This code is part of the 2024 [WXML](https://wxml.math.washington.edu/) Quiver Mutation, a special Cluster Algebra Research Project at University of Washington. The main purpose of the code is to check whether a directed graph with four vertices and variable weights can be transformed into a 4-cyclic graph through a finite number of mutations.
